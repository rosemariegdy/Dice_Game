This project is written in Java. It is a dice game of Pig. 
Each player take turns rolling two dice. 
A player scores the sum of the 2 dice thrown, if a single number 1 is thrown on either die, the score for that whole turn is lost ("Pigged Out"). 
A 1 on both dice is scored as 25. During a single turn, a player may roll the dice as many time as they desire. 
The score for a single turn is the sum of the individual scores for each dice roll. 
The first player to reach the goal score wins unless a player scores higher in that same round. Everyone in the game must have the same number of turns.
